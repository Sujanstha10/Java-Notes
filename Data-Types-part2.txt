b. Floating point data types
-Float
-Double

a. Float data type
-5 to 6 decimal places of precision accuracy 
-Single precision
-Size: 4 byte
-Range: -3.4e38 to 3.4e38
-Wrapper class: Float
-Default value: 0.0

b. Double data type
-14 to 15  decimal places of precision accuracy
-Double precision
-Size: 8 byte
-Range: -1.7e308 to 1.7e308
-Wrapper class: Double
-Default value: 0.0


B. Non-Numeric Data types
i. Boolean data type
-Size: Not Applicable[Virtual Machine dependent]
-Range: Not Applicable [ but allowed values are true or false]
-Wrapper class: Boolean
-Default value: false
-Example:
boolean b = true; //right
boolean b = 0;  //compile-time error comes as incompatible types : fount int required boolean
boolean b = True;  // compile-time error saying cannot find saying found variable,location class...
boolean b = "True";  //C.E saying incompatibilty types found java.lang.string required boolean

int x=0;
if(x){
  System.out.println("hello")
}else{
  System.out.println("hi")
}
In this example, compile time error comes saying, Incompatible types found int , required boolean, 
because in older languages like c and c++ , 0 and 1 were also used to represent boolean values, but in java, it is not.

while(1){
  System.out.println("hello world")
}
In this program too, same compile time error comes as above.


ii. Char Data Type
Old languages like C or C++,  are ASCII code based and the number of allowed ASCII code characters are less than or equal to 256.
To represent these 256 characters, 8 bits are enough. Hence, the size of char in old languages is 1byte. 
But Java is UNICODE based and the number of different code characters are greater than 256 and less than or equal to 65536.
To represent these many characters, 8 bits may not be enough , compulsory we should go for 16 bits. Hence, the size of char in java is 2bytes.
Size:2bytes
Range:0 to 65535
Wrapper class: Character
Default value: 0 [represents space character]



Note: Null is a default value for Object reference and we can't apply for primitive data types, if we are trying to use for primitives,then
we will get compile-time error.
Exmple char ch = null;  //compile-time error comes as incompatible types, found <nulltype> required char
