***************** static control flow ******************************
Whenever we are executing a Java class , the following sequence of steps will be executed as a part of static control flow.
i. Identification of static members from top to bottom
ii. Execution of static variables assignments and static blocks from top to bottom
iii. Execution of main method

 Example:
 clas Base{
  static int i = 0;
  static
  {
    m1();
    Sopln("First static block");
  }
  public static void main(String[] args){
    m1();
    Sopln("main method");
  }
  public static void m1(){
    Sopln(j);
  }
  static
  {
    Sopln("second static block");
  }
  static int j = 20
 }


 Output:
 0
 First static block
 second static block
 20
 main method
