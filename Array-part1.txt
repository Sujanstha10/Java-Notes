****************Array**************
An array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogeneous data elements.
The main advantage of arrays is we can represent huge number of values by using single variable. So that, readability of the code will be improved.
But the main disadvantage of array is fixed in size.i.e, once we created an array, there is no chance of increasing or decreasing the size based on our requirement.
Hence, to use array's concept, compulsary we should know the size in advance, which may not be possible always.

****Array Declaration********
***One Dimensional Array Declaration****
int[] x; //valid
int []x; //valid
int x[]; //valid

but among these  first one is recommended to use because name is clearly separated from type.
This is one dimensional array declaration.

At the time of declaration, we can't specify the size otherwise we will get compile time error.
Example : int[6] x; //invalid
int[] x;  //valid

***Two-Dimesional Array Declaration***
int[][] x; //valid
int [][]x; //valid
int x[][]; //valid
int[] []x; //valid
int[] x[]; //valid
int []x[]; //valid

--Which of the following are valid--
int[] a,b;  a's dimension 1. b's dimension 1.
int[] a[],b; a's dimension 2. b's dimension 1.
int[] a[],b[]; a's dimension 2. b's dimension 2.
int[] []a,b; a's dimension 2. b's dimension 2.
int[] []a,b[]; a's dimension 2. b's dimension 3.
Above all are valid declaration.
int[] []x,[]b; //compile time error will occur. //invalid
If we want to specify dimension before the variable, that facility is applicable to only first variable in a declaraion.
If we are trying to apply for remaining variables, we will get compile time error.


**********THREE DIMENSIONAL ARRAY DECLARATION*****************
we can declare in these many ways:
int[][][] a;
int [][][]a;
int a[][][];
int[] [][]a;
int[] a[][];
int[] []a[];
int[][] []a;
int[][] a[];
int [][]a[];
int []a[][];
These all declaration for three dimensional array is valid.



***************ARRAY CREATION*******************
int[] a= new int[3];
Every array in Java is an object only, Hence, we can create arrays by using new operator.
int[] a = new int[3];


******for every array type, corresponding classes are there**********
These classes are part of  programming language level and not available to programmer level.

Array Type            Corresponding Class name
int[]            [I
int[][]          [[I
double[]         [D
short[]          [S
byte[]           [B
boolean[]        [Z


At the time of array creation, compulsory we should specify the size. Otherwise, we will get compile time error.
int[] x = new int[]; //invalid compile time error will occur.
int[] x = new int[6]; //valid 

It is legal to have to have an array with size 0 in Java.
int[] x = new int[0]; //valid

If we are trying to specify array size with some negative int value then we will get Runtime Exception saying negative array size exception.
int[] x = new int[-3];

To specify array  size, the allowed data types are byte,short,char,int.
If we are trying to specify any other data types then, we will get compile time error.
int[] x = new int[10];
int[] x = new int['a'];
byte b = 20;
int[] x = new int[b];
short s = 20;
int[] x =new int[s];
int[] x = new int[10l] //compile time error will occur saying incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from long to int

The maximum allowed Array Size in Java is 2147483647 which is the maximum value of int data type.
int[] x = new int[2147483647] //valid but runtime-error
int[] x = new int[2147483648] //compile time error will occur integer number too large.
Even in the first case,we may get Runtime Exception: insufficient heap memory not available.
