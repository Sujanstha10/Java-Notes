The main objective of new Operator is to create an object.
The main purpose of constructor is to initialize object.
First, object will be created by using new operator and then initialization will be performed by the constructor.
For example:
class Student{
  String name;
  int rollno;
  Student(String name, int rollno){
    this.name = name;
    this.rollno = rollno;
  }
}

Student s =  new Student("aashish",101);
here, new is responsible to create object s.
and, Student("aashish",101) is responsible to initialize object.
