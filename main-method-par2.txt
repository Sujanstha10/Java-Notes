Untill 1.6 version, if the class doesn't contain main method then we will get run-time exceptionn saying: NoSuchMethodError:main
But from 1.7 version onwards, instead of NoSuchMethodError , we will get more elaborated error information.i.e. Main method not found in class Test, please define main method as : public static void main(String[] args)

From 1.7 version onwards, main method is mandatory to start program execution. Even though class contains static block , it won't be executed if the class doesn't contain main method.


class Test{
  static{
    System.out.println("Static Block");
    System.exit(0)  //this statement meaning is shut down the JVM 
  }
}

This will be executed in 1.6 version but will not in 1.7 version because From 1.7 version onwards, main method is mandatory to start program execution.

Without writing main method, is it possible to print some statements to the console ? 
=> Yes, by using static block. But this rule is applicable untill 1.6 versio. but from 1.7 version onwards , it is impossible to print some statements to the console without writing main method.
