***********Flow-Control***********
Flow Control describes the order in which statements will be executed at run-time.
There are 3 types of flow-control statements:
a. Selection Statements
=> Among several options, only one option will be selected and will be executed.
=> if..else, switch

b. Iterative Statements
=> A group of statements will be executed iteratively.
=> while(), do-while(), for(), for-each loop

c. Transfer Statements
=> These statements alter the flow of control by transferring it to a different part of the program, hence the term "transfer."
=> break,continue,return,try-catch-finally,assert()
