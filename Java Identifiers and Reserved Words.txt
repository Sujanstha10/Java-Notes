Identifiers: Identifiers are names given to various programming elements such as variables, methods, classes, packages, etc. 
Identifiers are user-defined names.
They must adhere to specific rules:
1.Composed of letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
2.Must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
3.Cannot begin with a digit.
So, examples of valid identifiers are: total_number, total123, ca$h, _$_$_$_$, aasish1Panthee, Integer, Int
 examples of invalid-identifiers are : total#, aashish@panthee, int

Java reserved words:   are predefined identifiers/words that have special meanings and are reserved by the Java language for specific purposes.
There are 53 reserved words in Java.
Keywords(50) and Reserved Literals(3)
Used Keywords(48) and Ununsed Keywords(2)
Used Keywords: if else,switch, etc    Unused keywords: goto, const
Reserved Liters = true,false,null

If the reserved words only represent the functionality. i.e Keywords
If the reserved words only represent the value. i.e Reserved Literals

let's get all the 53 reserved words:
Firstly Reserved Keywords(49)
Used Keywords (47):
Firstly Data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char
Secondly Flow Control: if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, return
Thirdly keywords for modifies: public, private, protected, static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp, transient, volatile
Fourthly Exception Handling: try, catch, throw, finally, throws, assert
Fifthly Class related keywords: class, interface, extends, implements, package, import
Sixly Object related keywords: new, instanceof, super, this
Seventhly Return type keyword: void

Unused Keywords (2):
goto => the use of goto is highly discouraged in modern programming because it often leads to unmaintainable and hard-to-understand code, known as "spaghetti code." ava deliberately omits this keyword.
const => In Java, the const keyword is reserved but not used. Constants in Java are typically declared using the final modifier along with static for class-level constants. 
-> If we try to use goto and const in Java, we will get compile time error.

Secondly, Reserved Literals (3):
true,false,null
true,false => values for boolean data type
null => default value for object reference

Thirdly, Enum keyword (1) i.e enum
--Enum is a group of named constants. We can use enum to define group of named constants.

NOTE/Conclusion: In Java, we do not have delete keyword because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of garbage collector.
strictfb,assert,enum are new keywords in java.

Now, let’s analyze  code snippet: int String = 000;.
The keyword int is used to declare an integer variable.
The identifier String is allowed, even though String is a predefined class in Java.
Why does this compile?
In this case, String is treated as an identifier, not as the predefined class.
However, it’s essential to note the following:
While it’s technically allowed, it’s best practice to avoid using predefined class names (like String) as identifiers.
Doing so can lead to confusion and hinder code readability.
