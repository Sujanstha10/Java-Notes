Multi-tasking
=> Executing several tasks simultaneously is a concept of multi-tasking.
There are two types of multi-tasking : Process-based multi-tasking , Thread-based multi-tasking

i. Process based multi-tasking
=> Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a seperate independent program(process) is called process-based multi-tasking.
  Example: while typing a java program in the editor , we can listen audio songs from the same system and at the same time we can download a file from internet.
  All these tasks will be executed simultaneously and independent of each other. Hence, it is process-based multi-tasking.
=> Process based multi-tasking is best suitable at Operating System (O.S) level.


ii. Thread based multi-tasking
=> Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent part of the same program is called Thread based multi-tasking. Each independent part is called is called a Thread.
=> Thread based multi-tasking is best suitable at programmatic level.


Whether it is process based or Thread based , the main objective of multi-tasking is to reduce response time of the system (ideal time of CPU) and to improve performance.

The main important application areas of multi-threading are:
a. To develop multi-media graphics.
b. To develop animations.
c. To develop video games.
d. To develop web servers and application servers, etc.

When compared with the old languages, developing multi-threaded applications in Java is very easy because Java provides in-built support for multi-threading with rich API (Thread,Runnable,ThreadGroup).
